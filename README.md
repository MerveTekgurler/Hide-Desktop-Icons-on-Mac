# Hide-Desktop-Icons-on-Mac
This is a short note about how to turn all the desktop icons on my Mac invisible with one click

I wanted to have an easy way of making all the folders on my desktop invisible when I share my screen and did not want to pay for an app. I could not find any online tutorials that are as practical as mine, so I decided to write one myself. Also, in case I forget how I did this, I wanted to have some documentation.

This repository has code for hiding and un-hiding the icons with one click using Mac Shortcuts and Terminal.
